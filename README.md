A lamp that makes user feel in a chosen mood(eg. Focused, Calm, Energetic, Sleepy, Happy, Sad)

The Mood Lamp project is an Arduino based programmable lamp that allows users to select different colour mods that will match their mood. The colours have already been researched, selected and implemented to the program code and the user will be able to select specific “mood” using the IR Remote control.
